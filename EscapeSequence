#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    // we are using \OOO escape sequence, here 
    // each O in "OOO" is one to three octal 
    // digits(0....7).
    char* s = "A\0725";
    printf("%s", s);
    return 0;
}
Output:

A:5
Explanation : Here 000 is one to three octal digits(0….7) means there must be atleast one octal digit after \ and maximum three.Here 072 is the octal notation, first it is converted to decimal notation that is the ASCII value of char ‘:’. At the place of \072 there is : and the output is A:5.



// C program to illustrate \XHH escape 
// sequence
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    // We are using \xhh escape sequence.
    // Here hh is one or more hexadecimal
    // digits(0....9, a...f, A...F).
    char* s = "B\x4a";
    printf("%s", s);
    return 0;
}
Output:

BJ
Explanation : Here hh is one or more hexadecimal digits(0….9, a…f, A…F).There can be more than one hexadecimal number after \x. Here, ‘\x4a’ is a hexadecimal number and 
it is a single char. Firstly it will get converted into decimal notation and it is the ASCII value of char ‘J’. Therefore at the place of \x4a, we can write J. So the output is BJ.



// C program to illustrate \r escape 
// sequence
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    // Here we are using \r, which
    // is carriage return character.
    printf("Hello fri \r ends");
    return (0);
}
Output: (Depend upon compiler)

ends
